- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with consistent design tokens
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Use Next.js App Router file-based routing
- Create reusable components in the `components` directory
- Use proper error handling and loading states

## Design System
- Primary color: Cyan/Turquoise (#22D3EE or similar)
- Background: Light gray/white tones
- Typography: Clean, modern fonts
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale

## API Structure
- Mock API endpoints in `app/api/` directory
- Authentication endpoints for login and OTP verification
- RESTful API design patterns
- Proper error responses and status codes

## Component Organization
- Page components in `app/` directory following App Router structure
- Reusable UI components in `components/` directory
- Custom hooks in `hooks/` directory
- Utilities and helpers in `lib/` or `utils/` directory
- Types and interfaces in `types/` directory
